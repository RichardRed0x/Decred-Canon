# decred-canon
A collection of readings and resources to help people familiarize themselves with the Decred Project. To start, we will segment the list into Getting Started, History, Hybridized PoW/PoS Consensus, Decred Governance, Politeia, Protocol Funding, Stakepools, Block Explorers, Network Data Sources, Discussion Forums, Wallets, Exchanges, Stakeholders to Follow, Newsletters. We plan to add more sections and content as they become necessary. Community members are welcome to submit pull requests for new additions. 

### Getting Started
Decred is a cryptocurrency that uses hybrid Proof of Work/Proof of Stake to enable decentralization and stakeholder governance. In Decred, both miners and stakeholders are required to apend blocks to its ledger, creating a more fair checks and balances system between users, miners, and developers. Stakeholders are also able to vote on consensus rule changes and off-chain governance initiatives created as proposals on Politeia. 

Decred is positioning itself to be a hypersecure, adaptable, and self-sustaining store of value. Its hybrid consensus model requires far more work to rewrite the chain, its open governance process consistently produces innovation, and its treasury will be managed entirely by its stakeholders. Decred is iterating on how to both program digital value and how to coordinate open source systems.
