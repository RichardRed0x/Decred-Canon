## Introduction

Decred is a hypersecure, adaptable, and self-sustaining cryptocurrency. 

Its hybrid Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake consensus model is costlier to attack than Proof-of-Work alone; its open governance process encourages and streamlines permissionless, bottom-up innovation; its continually-minted treasury is managed by holders of its native asset (DCR) and already in excess of 500,000 DCR. Decred is iterating on technological, social, and political fronts.
